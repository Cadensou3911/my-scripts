{"script":"Super idol’s smile\n
Not your sweetness\n
Octades in August\n
Nothing you are dazzling\n
Love you 105 ° C\n
Drip pure distilled water\n
You don’t know how cute you have.\n
I will laugh and stand up after falling.

Not afraid that I am\n
Let me come\n
Brave chasing your dreams\n
That firm look\n
